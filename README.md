# in via, travel and leisure blockchain

## Introduction

Hotel nights, flight seats, opera tickets and a place in an exotic expedition ca be seen as NFTs.

## Actors

- Travelers
- Hosts (hotels, airlines, tourist attractions, guides, the ones giving the real experience to the traveler)
- Helpers (CRC services, translators, any service needed byt the hosts to create a better experience for the traveler)
- Middle mans (travel companies, tour operators, bed banks, channel managers, the ones that facilitate the travel more on the side of communication, aggregation)

## Availability

Travel industry spends on availability calculations a lot. Over and over tons of CPU cycles are used to know the price of a room in Paris for the next week. This calculus takes a lot of parameters, mostly all commercial ones totally obscure for the traveler, like the discounts the middle man have, the taxes that needs to pay with the ten financial companies they uses to bill their clients which are doing a very similar calculus for the traveler.

An NFT distributed database will make all that obsolete. The availability and the price are always public.

In the most simple operation the _host_ publish what they want to sell and its price. The _traveler_ interact with the blockchain and get that price.

_Host_ can drop rooms at a fixed price or to an auction. They can also set if they are allowing re-sales and a fee for the resale. Of course, there are cancellation fees.

## Privacy

All booking will remain anonymous until the moment of enjoying the service. At the check in the user can show an confirmation code generated  with their private key.

Some service, like some flights, requires some personal information in advance, like nationality. On this can of services hosts can specify that data and if they allow last minute changes of ownership.

All bookings even between the same traveler and host will be anonymized. The host will not be able to track previous booking from the same traveler in the blockchain unless the traveler allow it (usually as part of some loyalty program) but in anyway the relationship will be private in the bloackchian.

## Bundles & Bids

## Private resale

Did you book a room for that Champions Final in Barcelona and your team did not get to final? Re sale that room to a fixed price or in an auction! The _host_ will get a part but there will be no cancellation.

## Blockchain rewards and governance

### Travelers points

### Host points

## Industry play or independent

We can make the travel industry a more fair one. Why traveling to xxx which is 10k km from home is cheaper than going to the country next to ours? Costs. Simple, but that implies that people get less for the same work.
