## Introduction

Hotel nights, flight seats, opera tickets and a place in an exotic expedition ca be seen as NFTs.

## Actors

- Travellers
- Hosts (hotels, airlines, tourist attractions, guides, the ones giving the real experience to the traveler)
- Middle mans (travel companies, tour operators, bed banks, channel managers, the ones that facilitate the travel more on the side of communication, aggregation)

## Availability

Travel industry spends on availability calculations a lot. Over and over tons of CPU cycles are used to know the price of a room in Paris for the next week. This calculus takes a lot of parameters, mostly all commercial ones totally obscure for the traveller, like the discounts the middle man have, the taxes that needs to pay with the ten financial companies they uses to bill their clients which are doing a very similar calculus for the traveller.

An NFT distributed database will make all that obsolete. The availability and the price are always public.

In the most simple operation the _host_ publish what they want to sell and its price. The _traveller_ interact with the blockchain and get that price.

## Industry play or independent

We can make the travel industry a more fair one. Why traveling to xxx which is 10k km from home is cheaper than going to the country next to ours? Costs. Simple, but that implies that people get less for the same work.
