# Who we are

We are [this team](https://github.com/orgs/tripl-to/people) ... but we're looking forward more people to join us, come
in!

## Why is this distributed as MIT

We are in the middle of a turn in history. A decentralised travel blockchain is inevitable, it's not about _if_ it's
just about _when and who_. We hope we can help to create a fair one. One that warranties the freedom of host and
travelers to offer and enjoy the best experiences.

We would love to send this idea to the European Research Found. That founds are giving priority to collaborative
projects between universities and several companies. We truly believe that frameworks is the ideal to develop a new
industry standard that will change how we buy and trade our travels.
