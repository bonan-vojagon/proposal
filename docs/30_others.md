# Other projects

## Blockchain projects
 - [Winding Tree](https://windingtree.com/) They did a presentation back in 2017 in Hotelbeds. Almost the same idea.
 - [Otium Technologies](https://otiumtechnologies.com/) They are in Mallorca. A similar idea too.
 - [Travel inblock](https://travel-inblock.io/) (ex HBG people, very vague definition of the product)
 - [Travel Coin](https://tcoin.one/) Scam?

## Portals with blockchain integrations
 - [Travala](https://www.travala.com/) They define itself as "Cryptocurrency Friendly Travel Booking". They accept 
   payments in crypto, and they have an incentive program with its own token and NFTs, but they don't implement a travel 
   blockchain. They partnered with Expedia and [Binance](https://www.travala.com/binance).
