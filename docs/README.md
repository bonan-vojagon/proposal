## TRIPL solves

Any technology should solve a problem. Our objective with TRIPL is to solve these problems:

- Avoid redundant availability calculations across the industry for the same allotment/resource.
- Avoid unexpected cost on cancellation due to currencies fluctuation.
- Reduce financial complexity.

## TRIPL extra benefits

- Simplify the direct link between actors. All hotels publish with the same protocol, all clients consume with the same protocol. That creates an open market.
- Smart contracts ensure all players clear and well known rules. That rules are developed also with a direct governance also clear and well known.
- Open market protocol ensure a decentralized diversity of implementations, specially for _helpers_.

## TRIPL philosophy

- TRIPL is not a company. TRIPL is a project to implement an open market protocol, based on a set of smart contracts,  with direct governance of all actors (including the travelers).
- TRIPL is a disruptive technology that gives an opportunity to all current actors to play a role an stay in the business improving its currect value.  
- TRIPL should be a join effort between the travel and cryptocurrency industries, the universities and the European Union.
