# TRIPL = smart travel industry protocol

**TLDR for blockchain experts: Hotel nights, flight seats, opera tickets and a place in an exotic expedition can be
seen as NFTs.**

TRIPL allows direct interaction between _hosts_ (hotels, airlines, activities...) and travelers. TRIPL is
a protocol that enables a new open and distributed market based on web3, smart contracts and blockchain technologies.
It allows the industry to interact in a new way, between hosts and travellers.

On top of the current industry applications new ones could be developed, such as:

- Allotment auctions.
- Cross _hosts_ and traveller points/fidelity programs.
- A new reputation system for both _hosts_ and travellers that can integrate with old ones. Those reputation points
  will be used to governance the network (Decentralized Autonomous Organization).
- Packages can be created directly inside the blockchain. Package creators will not need direct contracts with each 
  _host_. They will be able to _bundle_ packages joining each _hosts_ availability.
- Credit lines could be provided based on the _host_'s _"locked on contract"_ sales.

## TRIPL solves

Any technology should solve a problem. Our objective with TRIPL is to solve these problems:

- Avoid redundant availability calculations across the industry for the same allotment/resource.
- Avoid unexpected cost on cancellation due to currencies fluctuation.
- Reduce financial complexity.
- Reduce contracting complexity. The smart contract, the code, is the contract.

## TRIPL extra benefits

- Simplify the direct link between actors. All hotels publish with the same protocol, all clients consume with the same
  protocol. That creates an open market.
- Smart contracts ensure all players clear and well known rules. That rules are developed also with a direct governance
  also clear and well known.
- Open market protocol ensure a decentralized diversity of implementations, specially for _helpers_.

## TRIPL philosophy

- TRIPL is not a company. TRIPL is a project to implement an open market protocol, based on a set of smart contracts,
  with direct governance of all actors (including the travelers).
- TRIPL is a disruptive technology that gives an opportunity to all current actors to play a role and stay in the
  business improving its current value.
- TRIPL should be a join effort between the travel and cryptocurrency industries, the universities and the European
  Union.

## TRIPL challenges

We identify the following challenges:

- To represent the full allotment of a _host_ in a blockchain.
- Identity management in a way that enables anonymity at blockchain level and still serve the industry and legal
  requirements.
- _Host_ validation: _host_ must be verified to ensure the quality.
